# Description

Implementation for Karger's randomized contraction algorithm for the min cut problem.

More about Karger's algorithm [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karger%27s_algorithm).


# Usage

Make test files with:

```bash
make
```

Run simple test with:

```bash
./test
```

Run tests from Stanford's [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithm-design-analysis/discussions/weeks/3/threads/E3Pf9DJCEeaoXg7YgQ2Cfw) Algorithms course:

```bash
./coursera_test
```

To include heavy test with 200 vertices and 20k iterations:

```bash
./coursera_test ON
```
